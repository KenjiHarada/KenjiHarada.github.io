[Ising model on a square lattice]
</p>
<p>
We plot the local magnetization (up or down) as a color block in the
square lattice.  Here, the system size is \(L=100\). We update the
spin configuration with one click for 100 MCS in the case of
Metropolis or Swendsen-Wang algorithm and 100 steps in the case of
Wolff algorithm.  The vertical position of the clicked pointer
controls the value of parameter \(z (\equiv \exp(2J/T) - 1)\). The
horizontal position also selects the Monte Carlo algorithm.  The left,
center, and right cases are Metropolis, Swendsen-Wang, and Wolff
algorithms, respectively.

<p>When environment, such as temperature, changes, the system which
consists of many interacting elements may shift to the state where the
law of a micro level is broken.</p>

<p>For example, if a hot metal is cooled, the magnetization will
appear spontaneously. Then, the local magnetization of each atom
points to the specific direction. Since the small magnetization of
each atom does not necessary like a specific direction with the law of
a micro level, the spontaneous magnetization is a specific character
for many atoms which interact each other.</p>

<p>In the Ising model, each atom is in a lattice site and the
magnetization takes only two opposite states like north or south. And
each atom only interacts with the nearest neighbor sites so that the
direction of their magnetizations become equal when the temperature
falls. However, the direction of either is not necessarily
preferred.</p>

<p>Although it is in fact a simple model, the phenomenon that the whole
atoms take a same direction occurs at a certain temperature. This
corresponds to the appearance of the spontaneous magnetization.
Thus, the Ising model is very well researched as a
fundamental model in such the phenomenon.</p>

<p>In the present demonstration, we can see the state of the Ising model
on the two-dimensional square lattice at a temperature \(T\).
At low temperature (\(z \ge \sqrt{2}\)), the big island appears rapidly.
It corresponds to the spontaneous magnetization.</p>

<p>In this <em>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</em> simulation, we can change algorithms (<em>Metropolis</em>, <em>Swendsen-Wang</em>, and <em>Wolff</em> ) which generates the
states. Especially Swendsen-Wang or Wolff algorithm can sample various states at a small
step. These algorithms are often used in the recent MCMC
simulations of Ising model.</p>
