          ABSTRACT:   To examine the validity of the scenario of the deconfined critical
  phenomena, we carry out a quantum Monte Carlo simulation for the
  SU($N$) generalization of the Heisenberg model with four-body and
  six-body interactions.  The quantum phase transition between the
  SU($N$) N\'eel and valence-bond solid phases is characterized for
  $N=2,3,$ and $4$ on the square and honeycomb lattices.  While
  finite-size scaling analysis works well up to the maximum lattice
  size ($L=256$) and indicates the continuous nature of the phase
  transition, a clear systematic change towards the first-order
  transition is observed in the estimates of the critical exponent $y
  \equiv 1/\nu$ as the system size increases.  We also confirm the
  relevance of a squared valence-bond solid field $\Psi^2$ for the SU(3)
  model.

          ABSTRACT: Using a generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation combined with the defining representation of the SO(N) spin, we map the SO(N) bilinear-biquadratic(BLBQ) spin chain into the N-color bosonic particle model. We find that, when the Jordan-Wigner transformation disentangles the symmetry-protected topological entanglement, this bosonic model becomes negative-sign free in the context of quantum Monte-Carlo simulation. For the SO(3) case, moreover, Kennedy-Tasaki's transformation for the S=1 BLBQ chain, which is also a topological disentangler, derives the same bosonic model through the dimer-R bases. We present temperature dependence of energy, entropy and string order parameter for the SO(N=3, 4, 5) BLBQ chains by the world-line Monte-Carlo simulation for the N-color bosonic particle model.

          ABSTRACT: Based on the worm algorithm, we propose a general
          quantum Monte Carlo algorithm suitable for parallelization
          with domain-decomposition. Of particular importance is its
          application to simulations of huge lattice systems of bosons
          and spins on a distributed-memory computer. A large number
          of worms are introduced and its population is controlled by
          a fictitious transverse field. For a benchmark, we
          demonstrate the size-dependence of the Bose-condensation
          order parameter by applying the algorithm to the hardcore
          Bose-Hubbard model with L x L x \beta t =
          10,240 x 10,240 x 16 using 3,200 computing cores of
          Fujitsu's FX10, which shows good parallelization efficiency.

          ABSTRACT: We performed variational calculation based on the multi-scale entanglemnt
renormalization ansatz, for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Shastry
Sutherland lattice (SSL). Our results show that at coupling ratio J'/J=
0.687(3), the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from the orthogonal
dimer order to the plaquette valence bond solid phase, which then transits into
the antiferromagnetic order above J'/J=0.75. In the presence of an external
magnetic field, our calculations show clear evidences of various magnetic
plateaux in systems with different coupling ratios range from 0.5 to 0.69. Our
calculations are not limited to the small coupling ratio region, and we are
able to show strong evidence of the presence of several supersolid phases,
including ones above 1/2 and 1/3 plateaux. Such supersolid phases, which
feature the coexistence of compressible superfluidity and crystalline long
range order in triplet excitations, emerge at relatively large coupling ratio
(J'/J>0.5). A schematic phase diagram of the SSL model in the presence of
          magnetic field is provided.

          ABSTRACT: The ground state of an S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a
  spatially anisotropic triangular lattice, which is an effective
  model of Mott insulators on a triangular layer of organic charge
  transfer salts or Cs2CuCl4, is numerically studied. We
  apply a numerical variational method by using a tensor network with
  entanglement renormalization, which improves the capability of
  describing a quantum state. Magnetic ground states are identified
  for 0.7 &lt;= J2/J1 &lt;= 1 in the thermodynamic limit, where J1
  and J2 denote the inner-chain and inter-chain coupling constants,
  respectively. Except for the isotropic case (J1=J2), the
  magnetic structure is spiral with an incommensurate wave vector that
  is different from the classical one. The quantum fluctuation weakens
  the effective coupling between chains, but the magnetic order
  remains in the thermodynamic limit. In addition, the incommensurate
  wave number is in good agreement with that of the series expansion
  method.

          ABSTRACT: To calculate a ground state of quantum many-body
systems, variational methods with tensor network states were proposed
and investigated in recent years. In particular, two types of tensor
network states, PEPS and MERA, are of great interest. The former is a
generalization in higher dimensional systems of AKLT (matrix product)
state. The latter is based on a coarse-graining transformation
removing short-range entanglements between coarse-grained regions,
which is called an entanglement renormalization. Since these tensor
network states obey the area law of entanglement entropy, they are
regarded as one of the most promising tools for treating numerically
unsolved problems on quantum many-body systems. In this talk, after
the brief introduction of the MERA tensor network state, we will show
an application of MERA for quantum frustrated magnets: spin-1/2
spatially anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet and another model.

          ABSTRACT: We report variational calculations for the ground states in
the spatially anisotropic triangular antiferromagnets. The variational
wave function is based on the tensor network with an entanglement
renormalization. The entanglement renormalization improves the ability
of describing a quantum state. We define two groups of Heisenberg
couplings on a triangular lattice: one on links along a lattice axis
and the other on other links. J1 and J2 denote the coefficient of
their couplings, respectively. We confirm a magnetic phase in the
region of 0.7 &lt J2/J1 &lt= 1. The magnetic structure is
incommensurate, and the wave vector is not consistent with that of a
classical model except for J1=J2.

          ABSTRACT: To determine the universality class of critical phenomena,
  we propose a method of statistical inference in the scaling analysis
  of critical phenomena. The method is based on Bayesian statistics,
  most specifically, the Gaussian process regression. It assumes only
  the smoothness of a scaling function, and it does not need a
  form. We demonstrate this method for the finite-size scaling
  analysis of the Ising models on square and triangular lattices. Near
  the critical point, the method is comparable in accuracy to the
  least-square method. In addition, it works well for data to which we
  cannot apply the least-square method with a polynomial of low
  degree. By comparing the data on triangular lattices with the
  scaling function inferred from the data on square lattices, we
  confirm the universality of the finite-size scaling function of the
  two-dimensional Ising model.
